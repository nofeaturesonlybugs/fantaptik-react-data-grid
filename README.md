  A basic grid accepts the data as a property.
  * [Paginated async provider `<Grid.PagesProvider />`](https://nofeaturesonlybugs.github.io/fantaptik-react-data-grid/#/Components/Grid.PagesProvider)  
  `<Grid.PagesProvider />` uses promises to fetch pages of data as the user navigates via pagination controls.

  `<Grid.FeedProvider />` uses promises to fetch data in chunks as the user continuously scrolls the grid.

### API Consistency and Breaking Changes  
I am making a very concerted effort to break the API as little as possible while adding features or fixing bugs.  However this software is currently in a pre-1.0.0 version and breaking changes *are* allowed under standard semver.  As the API approaches a stable 1.0.0 release I will list any such breaking changes here and they will always be signaled by a bump in *minor* version.

* 0.3.0 â­¢ 0.4.0  
  A number of changes were made to support custom cell renderers.  
  + `getColumns` has been renamed to `statRow` and returns a different shape.
  + `useColumns` has a different return shape and the columns no longer contain sizing information, which is now stored in `<Rows />`.
  + `<Sample />` has been renamed to `<Rows.Sample />` and is now rendered as a child of `<Rows />` instead of `<Grid />`.  In short `<Rows />` now handles the measuring of cells+headers and the information doesn't need to leak upwards into the `<Grid />` (by way of the `useColumns` hook as it did in 0.3.0).
  + `<Progress />` has been renamed to `<Grid.FeedProvider.Progress />` as that progress component was intended to be used with and only with the `<Grid.FeedProvider />`.
